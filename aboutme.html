        <h1>My life in a nutshell</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>About my starting</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in allahabad (modern day prayagraj) on 22nd September 2002. Since my birth I had spent nearly 5 years of my life in that same city. I soon after left to live in UAE when my dad got a job over there. Those were the most splendid years of my life. As a child I still remember many days and instances of my life. Times when I cried, times when I was being straight up naughty as a kid and times when I got appreciation from adults for something. One thing that I didn't have incommon with a lot of other kids is I woke up daily laughing and enjoying, unlike my younger sister who still wakes up in the morning triggered for some reason.

        <h2>About my life at UAE</h2>
        <p>
            I spent around six to seven years in UAE in total and those years taught me a lot about how we look at life. I did have days of trauma,happiness and sadness just like any other person. What makes those years so special is the fact that our family enjoyed and cherished every moment of their life irrespective of them being absolutely broke. Back then I had no idea of what it mean to be broke to be honest. My dad is an absolute chad when it comes to dealing with problems. That is my biggest take away from him. We soon after moved to Qatar as my dad got a job over there after the recession.

        <h2>About my life at Qatar</h2>
        <p>
            The initial years of our stay here were difficult as we found it difficult to adjust to the new environment. We pushed however. My parents did the level best when it came to providing us. I completeled my 12th standard of my school here and took a drop year to prepare for JEE exam. That drop year possibly was the most stressful year of my life. The shubh that was unaware of life, didn't bother knowing what was stress and anxiety, that was insecure, that was quiet and extremely aggreable died that year. Then can along a new shubh. One with a vision. One who realized the importance of life. One who realized how fragile human life is. One who started to see life quiet differently. For the first time I was interested to know why things were the way they were. What was the nature of the things around me. I wondered why did people became angry, sad and happy for certain things. I felt like a new beginning. 
            <br><br>
            Back then I had seen a youtube video when a man was asked what was the most thing that he was most grateful about and he replied by saying that he is grateful to be alive. When I listened to this, It didn't bother me so much. No that I look back upon it, I too seem to be in the same position to say the same thing about myself. I am grateful to be alive. I am grateful to feel the heat when the sunlight falls on my palms. I am grateful to breathe life in every breath I take. Its like life doing its job, telling me with every breath that I am privileged to be alive. What motivates me to keep pushing in life is the fact that one day I'll get to improve other people's life. I think I would love if people remembered me for what I have done but, I don't care about anyone remembering me. The sole purpose of human beings is to push humanity forward in my opinion. Thats what I have learnt from the nature of nature.

            I soon after left qatar after the drop year to join mahindra universtiy where I am studying computer science.
